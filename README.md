# 7DRL2013
This was my first completed game for the 7 Day Roguelike in 2013 though not my greatest acomplishment, it led to many new things.
Shadows of Humanity as the game is called, was made in Java using the Slick2D and LWJGL libraries

The game is a top down shooter whith some dumb AI and randomly generated infinite terrain. It was my first attempt at Procedutral terrain generaiton.
